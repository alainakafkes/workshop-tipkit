# Architecting feature walkthroughs, pre- and post-TipKit

Soon to be presented at [ARCtic Conference](https://arcticonference.com/) in March 2025.

## Abstract

How might we guide our users through a new or experimental feature?

In this workshop, we'll use TipKit to highlight the noteworthy elements of a dense feature. We'll also learn how to create a custom tooltip solution in SwiftUI, which can be leveraged by apps that support operating systems below iOS 17.

And, lest we overwhelm our users with too much education, we'll learn good design principles for determining when and how to ask for usersâ€™ attention.
